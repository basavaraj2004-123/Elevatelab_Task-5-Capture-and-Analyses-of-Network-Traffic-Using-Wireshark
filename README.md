# Wireshark Network Traffic Capture and Analysis - Task 5

## Project Overview

This project involves capturing live network packets using Wireshark on a Kali Linux system and analyzing the network traffic to identify various protocols such as HTTP, TCP/TLS, and DNS. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in network protocol analysis and traffic inspection.

## Tools Used

- Wireshark (Free and open-source network protocol analyzer)
- Kali Linux OS within VMware environment

## Project Steps

1. Installed and launched Wireshark on Kali Linux.
2. Selected the active network interface (`eth0`) for traffic capture.
3. Captured live network packets while browsing websites and generating network activity.
4. Applied Wireshark filters to isolate and analyze packets belonging to HTTP, TCP/TLS, and DNS protocols.
5. Recorded packet details and summarized findings based on protocol behavior.
6. Saved capture in `.pcap` format for reference.

## Protocols Analyzed

- HTTP (Web traffic)
- TCP and TLS (Connection establishment and encrypted data)
- DNS (Domain name resolution requests and responses)

## Deliverables

- Packet capture `.pcap` file
- Screenshots showcasing different protocol captures and analysis
- This detailed README and project report

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical skills in capturing and filtering network traffic.
- Understanding of key network protocols and their packet structures.
- Ability to use Wireshark for effective network troubleshooting.

## How to Run

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Select the appropriate network interface.
3. Start capturing packets.
4. Use packet filters such as `http`, `tcp`, or `dns` to analyze specific traffic.
5. Stop capture after desired data is collected.
6. Save the capture file for further analysis.
